	<h1>I like to go swimming in the summer.</h1>
<br>
	<br>
	<p>Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. when the sun is shining
	<br>and the air is warm, you will find me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not an 
	<br>impresssive pool, only three feet deep, but it's mine.
</p>
	<br>
	<br><p>There are three reasons I like to swim:</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>I get lots of exercise</li>
		<li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
		<li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun.</li>
	</ul>
